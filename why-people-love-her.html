[![](http://www.python.org/community/logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)](http://www.python.org/community/logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.90625px;">There's
nothing wrong with falling in love with a programming language for her
looks. I mean, let's face it - Python does have a rockin' body of
modules, and a damn good set of utilities and interpreters on various
platforms. Her whitespace-sensitive syntax is easy on the eyes, and it's
a beautiful sight to wake up to in the morning after a long night of
debugging. The way she sways those releases on a consistent cycle - she
knows how to treat you right, you know?</span>

<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.90625px;">But
let's face it - a lot of other languages see the attention she's
getting, and they get jealous. Really jealous. They try and make her
feel bad by pointing out the GIL, and they try and convince her that
she's not "good enough" for parallel programming or enterprise-level
applications. They say that her lack of static typing gives her
programmers headaches, and that as an interpreted language, she's not
fast enough for performance-critical applications.</span>  

<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.90625px;">She
hears what those other, older languages like Java and C++ say, and she
thinks she's not stable or mature enough. She hears what those shallow,
beauty-obsessed languages like Ruby say, and she thinks she's not pretty
enough. But she's trying really hard, you know? She hits the gym every
day, trying to come up with new and better ways of JIT'ing and
optimizing. She's experimenting with new platforms and compilation
techniques all the time. She wants you to love her more, because she
cares.</span>  

<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.90625px;">But
then you hear about how bad she feels, and how hard she's trying, and
you just look into her eyes, sighing. You take Python out for a walk -
holding her hand - and tell her that she's the most beautiful language
in the world, but that's not the only reason you love her.</span>  

<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.90625px;">You
tell her she was raised right - Guido gave her core functionality and a
deep philosophy she's never forgotten. You tell her you appreciate her
consistent releases and her detailed and descriptive documentation. You
tell her that she has a great set of friends who are supportive and
understanding - friends like Google, Quora, and Facebook. And finally,
with tears in your eyes, you tell her that with her broad community
support, ease of development, and well-supported frameworks, you know
she's a language you want to be with for a long, long time.</span>  

<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.90625px;">After
saying all this, you look around and notice that the two of you are
alone. Letting go of Python's hand, you start to get down on one knee.
Her eyes get wide as you try and say the words - but she just puts her
finger on your lips and whispers, "Yes".</span>  

<span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17.90625px;">The
moon is bright. You know things are going to be okay now.</span>
