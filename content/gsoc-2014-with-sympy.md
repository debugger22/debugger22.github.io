My proposal is intended to add more to optics in SymPy. Till now it can
only do computations related to Gaussian optics and a bit of geometrical
optics. [Ondřej Čertík](https://github.com/certik) and [Sean
Vig](https://github.com/flacjacket) are my mentors for the project.

For those who don't know what is SymPy, SymPy is a Python library for
symbolic computation. It provides computer algebra capabilities either
as a standalone application, as a library to other applications, or live
on the web as SymPy Live. SymPy is trivial to install and to inspect
because is written entirely in Python and because it does not depend on
any additional libraries. This ease of access combined with a simple and
extensible code base in a well known language make SymPy a computer
algebra system with a relatively low barrier to entry. SymPy is free
software and is licensed under New BSD license. The lead developers are
Ondřej Čertík and Aaron Meurer.

Three more people other than me got selected for SymPy from my college,
namely, Akshay, Sachin Joglekar and Soumya Dipta Biswas.

During this *Community Bonding Period*I'll try to get familiar with the
huge code base of SymPy and its community of developers. I'm also
working on few old pull requests that are dead for so long.  
  
Looking forward to work with such a great organization! Thanks to Google
and SymPy for this opportunity!
