Last week I worked on utility functions which has been merged into the
master.

Currently I am working on converting my incopmlete PR related to
geometrical optics in 3D into 2D. Creating these classes in 3D will make
it difficult to use/extend. I referred to some books and I never saw use
of too much 3D in their illustrations. Depending on the use cases we can
consider adding it later after gsoc. As of now optics module can not be
called complete and hence I'll be working on it post gsoc.
