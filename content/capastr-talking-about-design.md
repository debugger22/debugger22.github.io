It was very difficult for me to choose the best and easiest framework to
use for UI design. After lot of research I decided to stick with
**JQueryMobile** since it has an awesome extension called
**ThemeRoller**.  
  
Working with a framework gives you enough time to work on core things
rather than thinking about the responsive design. Cordova is doing
pretty well with JQuery without loosing any frame.

I'm not very good at choosing colors, although Blue and Orange are my
all time favorite.  
  
Working with Android's push notification system is really a hectic job.
First you code for C2DM and then you get to know that it has been
deprecated by Google itself discourages the development. Google
introduced something new called Google Cloud Messaging(GCM). This works
pretty smooth once you have the registration Id of the device. Thanks
toÂ [geeknam](http://namis.me/) for proving such a fantastic library to
handle GCM with Python.  
I hope that Apple Push Notification Service(APNS) would not be a
headache like Android.   
I'll let you know about further development soon.  
  
***Enjoy!!***
