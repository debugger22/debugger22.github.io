[Hacker News'](https://news.ycombinator.com/)Â top 5 entries are some
beautiful stories that can't be missed by a technology enthusiast. The
problem is HN gives more weight-age to the period of existence of a post
and hence articles decay rapidly as time passes. I try my best to read
most of them but it's certainly not possible if you've got other things
to do. :)

To overcome this problem I wrote a small script to pull all those
entries and save it for me even when I'm away. Perhaps this will help my
obsession with hacker news.  

Once I have enough articles, I'll host them on the web with real time
addition of new articles for everyone. I'll think about other good
sources too.

&lt;/div&gt;
